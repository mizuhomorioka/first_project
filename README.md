# How large gender gap lays in the Japanese newsroom?
## about this project
this is a repository for my first project of [the Lede program 2023](https://ledeprogram.com/).
As a reporter of a national newspaper company in Japan, I feel Japanese newsrooms are male dominanted, and tried to visualize it.
I found relevant data from several website such as the Japan Newspaper Workers' Union and the Reuters Institute. I extracted the relevant section,and visualized it with [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/).
As predicted, I found that the average percentage of female repoerters in Japan was 24%, about two thirds of that in the U.S. In addition, as the position get higher, the percentage of female employees declines steadily. The female employees at the board was only a few percent.
The analysis with pandas to see if there are differences between local newspaper and national newspapers, but there were no significant differences.
I wanted to try more complicated analysis, such as using API, but seemingly it idea is not for API, so I gave up. Also, if I have found the detailed datas which show both percentage of female employee and female managers in the U.S. media companies, I could have done better analysis, but I couldn't find those data.
