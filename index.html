      <p>In 2015, when I joined my newspaper company, there were 15 reporters in my first assignment at the Shizuoka
        General Bureau. I was the only female reporter.</p>
      <p>Then later, I experienced another local branch office and several head office departments. In most of the
        report teams I worked in, there were only one or two women. It was commonplace to talk with reporters from other
        companies, and I didn't find it strange that there were fewer female reporters.</p>
      <p>I began to live in New York since last summer, and watch and listen American news, I was surprised to see how
        active women reporters are. Then I thought. Isn't the situation in Japanese newsroon strange?</p>
      <p>The chart below is the result of a survey conducted in 2020 by the Japan Newspaper Publishers Association labor
        union. The survey asked about the number and percentage of women in each of the following positions: reporter,
        team leader, manager class, executive class, board class of national and local newspapers in Japan. The chart
        shows the percentage of female reporters and the percentage of female managers (department management level)
        from the 41 companies that responded.</p>
      <p>Most newspapers are clumped in the lower left corner of the chart. The average percentage of female reporters
        was 22.42%; the average percentage of managers was 8.5%; 6 companies did not have a single female manager.</p>
