                         <p>In 2015, when I joined my newspaper company, there were 15 reporters in my first assignment at the Shizuoka General Bureau. I was the only female reporter.</p>
                         <p>Then later, I experienced another local branch office and several head office departments. In most of the report teams I worked in, there were only one or two women. It was commonplace to talk with reporters from other companies, and I didn't find it strange that there were fewer female reporters.</p>
