      <h1 class="title">How large gender gap lays in the Japanese newsroom?</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>By Mizuho Morioka</p>
        <p>June.25, 2023</p>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="equality.jpg" 　width="300" height="300px"></div>
        <p>In 2015, when I joined my newspaper company, there were 15 reporters in my first assignment at the Shizuoka
          General Bureau. I was the only female reporter.</p>

        <p>Then later, I experienced another local branch office and several head office departments. In most of the
          report teams I worked in, there were only one or two women. It was commonplace to talk with reporters from
          other
          companies, and I didn't find it strange that there were fewer female reporters.</p>

        <p>I began to live in New York since last summer, and watch and listen American news, I was surprised to see how
          active women reporters are. Then I thought. Isn't the situation in Japanese newsroom strange?</p>
        <p>The chart below is the result of a survey conducted in 2020 by the Japan Newspaper Publishers Association
          labor
          union. The survey asked about the number and percentage of women in each of the following positions: reporter,
          team leader, manager class, executive class, board class of national and local newspapers in Japan. The chart
          shows the percentage of female reporters and the percentage of female managers (department management level)
          from the 41 companies that responded.</p>
        <p>Most newspapers are clumped in the lower left corner of the chart. The average percentage of female reporters
          was 22.4%; the average percentage of managers was 8.5%; 6 companies did not have a single female manager.</p>

        <p>The percentage of women journalists in Japan is low: according to a 2022 survey by the Japan Newspaper
          Publishers Association and woman's media center, the average percentage of female journalists in Japanese
          newspapers was 24%, compared to 39% in American print newspapers.</p>
        <p>The Reuters Institute counted the number of "top editors" of the media in several countries in 2021.
          According to the report, the number of "top editors" in Japan was zero.
          There may be a problem with the tally. However, even assuming that "top editors" are similar level as
          "managers" in the aforementioned Japan Newspaper Labor' Union survey, and comparing the two surveys, the
          percentage of female managers in Japanese media is very low.</p>

        <p>let's look at the Board of Directors.
          In 2022, the percentage of women on the boards of Japanese newspaper companies was only 5.1%. TV stations were
          even more serious, with only 2.2%, and more than 70% of 127 TVs surveyed had no women on their boards. These
          figures were released by the Japan Newspaper Publishers Association and JAPAN FEDERATION OF COMMERCIAL
          BROADCAST WORKERS' UNIONS, respectively.
          Meanwhile, according to McKinsey's 2019 survey, American news media already had 28% women on their boards of
          directors.</p>

        </script>
        <p>According to last year's OECD survey, the average percentage of female executives in Japanese companies was
          15.5%. The media industry is lagging far behind.</p>
        <P>The absence of women in upper management and the workplace obviously creates a variety of flaws.
          Let me share an experience as an example.
          When I was still a rookie reporter at the local bureau, I tried to write an article about a woman who had
          suffered a miscarriage. However, the male editor clerk brushed it off, saying, "Such a story is not
          newsworthy."
          The one who took up the story was another male editor at the head quarter who has a disabled child. As a
          result, the article ran in the national edition and generated a huge response.Childbirth and miscarriage are
          topics that women are more familiar with. It was a man who both kicked my idea and wanted to publish it, but
          if there had been a woman involved, I doubt that it would have been so difficult to get the article published.
        </P>
        <P>In reverse, I feel that I was considered more than male peers because I am one of the few women. But what
          does that say about gender equality?</P>
        <p>News organizations cut out social events. It is a big problem that such a news organization is out of sync
          with the world. Half of the women in the world are not men.</p>
